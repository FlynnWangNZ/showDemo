## Functions
  - Email: As a QA, we always send emails of the release versions to many groups of members.  It is quite annoying to fill in the form by hand especially the version numbers from SVN server.  
  - Decode: Another useful tool for a company which develops customized protocol based on TCP and UDP. This helps to get human-readable format out of the data captured with TCPDUMP  
  - Jobs: This is the app I am using to record which jobs I have applied and all the following context like interviews and emails.
